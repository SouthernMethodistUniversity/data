# Data and power
What are the potentials of using data to solve problems or to advance research? What are the big problems or limitations?

## Different points of view 

### Data as liberation
“Liberation technology enables citizens to report news, expose wrongdoing, express opinions, mobilize protest, monitor elections, scrutinize government, deepen participation, and expand the horizons of freedom. But authoritarian states such as China, Belarus, and Iran have acquired (and shared) impressive technical capabilities to ﬁlter and control the Internet, and to identify and punish dissenters. Democrats and autocrats now compete to master these technologies. Ultimately, however, not just technology but political organization and strategy and deep-rooted normative, social, and economic forces will determine who ‘wins’ the race.” (Diamond, 2012)

## Data as advocacy, evidence
* Advocacy through data (e.g., Visualizing Information for Advocacy, 2013)
* Open/civic data
* As government accountability/transparency (Hoffman, 2012)
* BUT depends on volunteer labor, often addressed to governments and NGOs (Hooker, 2018) and belongs to the “data economy,” rather than being an act of critical transparency (Birchall, 2015)
 
“The data sets that make up Big Data are always creations of human design, and thus are always implicated in social relations and power dynamics (Andrejevic, 2014; boyd and Crawford, 2012; Crawford et al., 2014; Van Dijk, 2014). In these critical analyses, the ‘real’ value of (big) data lies not so much in its incarnation of a new scientiﬁc method or paradigm; rather, its value is framed in terms of political power, insofar as it enhances various forms of government surveillance (Bauman and Lyon, 2013), and in terms of monetary resource, as it beneﬁts corporate proﬁt (Fuchs, 2010).” (Sharon & Zandbergen, 2017)

## Examples of data resistance
* Group/participatory analysis of data (Jackson, 2008)
* Quantiﬁed/quantifying self movement (Sharon & Zandbergen, 2017)
* Data activism, both proactive & reactive (Milan & Van Der Velden, 2016)
 
“While digital humanists develop tools, data, and metadata critically...rarely do they extend their critique to the full register of society, economics, politics, or culture. How the digital humanities advances, channels, or resists today’s great postindustrial, neoliberal, corporate, and global ﬂows of information-cum-capital is thus a question rarely heard in the digital humanities associations, conferences, journals, and projects with which I am familiar. Not even the clichéd forms of such issues—for example, ‘the digital divide,’ ‘surveillance,’ ‘privacy,’ ‘copyright,’ and so on—get much play.”
(Liu, 2012)
