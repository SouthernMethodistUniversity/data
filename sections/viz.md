# Data Story Telling and Visualization

* :white_check_mark:Weâ€™d like each of you to go to [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) and read one of their data journalism pieces. 
* In their [archive](https://pudding.cool/archives/), you can choose by topic or type of chart, based on your interests. 

* As you read, pay special attention to the following questions::white_check_mark:

## Their Data
* Where did their data come from?
* Is the data public?
* How big was the data? Did they use all of it?

## Their Analysis
* What is their thesis statement?
* What was their hypothesis?
* What choices did they make as the analysis developed?
* Were there caveats or ramifications to their choices?
* What were their conclusions?

## Their Visualizations
* What types of visualizations did they use?
* Did the visualization help or hurt the arguments they made?
* Was the visualization distracting or confusing?
* Could you make a similar (if more simple) visualization?

## Overall 
* Did you think the article was interesting? 
* Did having data to back up their thesis statement help make their argument?
