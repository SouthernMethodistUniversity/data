# Data in the humanities 

## When we discuss using data in humanities research, what questions do we need to ask about our data sets?
* Do those sets even exist? 
* Are they openly accessible? 
* What restrictions might we encounter? 
    * Copyright
    * Licensing
    * Format
    * Cleanliness
* What ethical considerations might ensue? Institutional Review Boards (IRB) are meant to provide oversight for research studies (involving human subjects). Are IRBs sufficient, or are there additional considerations?
    * [SMU Research Compliance](https://www.smu.edu/Research/ResearchServices/ResearchCompliance)
* What does it mean to use data collected for one purpose for a different purpose? What is left out?

    * What humanities questions can you ask? 
    * Big Data, Medium Data, Small Data, Curated data, Clean data
* [Humanities Data in the Library: Integrity, Form, Access by Thomas Padilla](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march16/padilla/03padilla.html)
    * "Where traditional library objects like books, images, and audio clips begin to be explored as data, new considerations of integrity, form, and access come to the fore. **Integrity** refers to the documentation practices that ensure data are amenable to critical evaluation. **Form** refers to the formats and data structures that contain data users need to engage in a common set of activities. **Access** refers to technologies used to make data available for use."
    * "To what extent is information about Humanities data collection provenance, processing, and method of presentation available to the user?" (Posner cited by Padilla) 
    * "To what extent are data and the code that generates data available to the user?" (Stodden cited by Padilla)
    * "To what extent are the motivations driving all of the above available to the user?" (Risam cited by Padilla)
